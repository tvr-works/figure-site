# Implementation evidence

Checked October 22, 2026. Installed versions are pinned by the lockfile. Current stable packages at implementation: Vite 8.3.5, React 19.3.1, TypeScript 7.0.2, Tailwind 4.3.3, Base UI 1.9.0, shadcn CLI 4.22.1.

## Official documentation used

- [Vite multi-page builds](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html#multi-page-app): separate HTML entry points; Vite 8 uses `build.rolldownOptions`.
- [Tailwind with Vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite): dedicated Vite plugin and CSS import.
- [Tailwind browser compatibility](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/compatibility): modern browser baseline; app iOS requirements do not define website compatibility.
- [shadcn Vite installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite) and [CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli): CLI-generated Base components, semantic tokens, source owned by this repository. Current CLI accepts `--base base --preset nova`, although the skill examples still spell the preset `base-nova`.
- [Button](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/button), [Tabs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/tabs), [Collapsible](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/collapsible): use generated compositions and Base UI APIs.
- [Base UI Tabs](https://base-ui.com/react/components/tabs): manual activation separates arrow-key focus from selection.
- [Base UI accessibility](https://base-ui.com/react/overview/accessibility): primitives handle interaction mechanics; labels, focus visibility, contrast and behavior still need verification in this site.
- [React createRoot](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/createRoot): mount React in the demonstration region of an otherwise static page.
- [WCAG Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html): provide persistent playback controls for repeating demonstrations.

TypeScript 7 reports that `baseUrl` has been removed. The `@/*` alias uses explicitly relative `./src/*` paths instead. The Vite alias matches that path.

## App evidence

Native media is captured from the Figure app on a dedicated iOS 26.5 simulator, built without changing app code. Simulator screenshots from the MCP tool are optimized to 368px wide; `simctl io screenshot` is used for full-resolution source captures. Media is evidence of the captured examples, not a second calculator implementation or a claim of complete competitor parity.
